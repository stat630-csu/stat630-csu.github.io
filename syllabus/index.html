<h2>Course Objectives</h2>
<p>The aim of this course is to provide an overview of many statistical inference methods in modern statistical data analysis.</p>
</div>
<div id="learning-outcomes" class="section level2">
<h2>Learning Outcomes</h2>
<p>The students will be able to</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>implement likelihood-based methods to modern data analysis problems.</li>
<li>implement computation-based methods, e.g., jackknife, bootstrap, for statistical inference.</li>
<li>test statistical hypotheses using permutation and rank tests.</li>
<li>use nonparametric techniques for data analysis.</li>
<li>apply statistical inference tools, e.g., estimating equations, to evaluate validity and applicability
of data analysis results.</li>
<li>implement statistical inference tools in their future work/research.</li>
</ol>

<div id="covid-19" class="section level2">
<h2>COVID-19</h2>
<p><strong>Important information for students: All students are directed to report any COVID-19 symptoms to the university immediately, as well as exposures or positive test results from a medical provider or home test.</strong></p>
<p>If you suspect you have symptoms, or if you know you have been exposed to a positive person or have tested positive for COVID, (even with a home test), you are directed to fill out the COVID Reporter (<a href="https://covid.colostate.edu/reporter/" class="uri">https://covid.colostate.edu/reporter/</a>). If you know or believe you have been exposed, including living with someone known to be COVID positive, or are symptomatic, it is important for the health of yourself and others that you complete the online COVID Reporter. Do not ask your instructor to report for you. If you do not have internet access to fill out the online COVID-19 Reporter, please call (970) 491-4600. You may also report concerns in your academic or living spaces regarding COVID exposures through the COVID Reporter. You will not be penalized in any way for reporting. When you complete the COVID Reporter for any reason, the CSU Public Health office is notified. Students who report symptoms or a positive antigen test through the COVID Reporter may be directed to get a PCR test through the CSU Health Network’s medical services for students.</p>
<p>For the latest information about the University’s COVID resources and information, please visit the <strong>CSU COVID-19 site</strong>: <a href="https://covid.colostate.edu/" class="uri">https://covid.colostate.edu/</a>.</p>
