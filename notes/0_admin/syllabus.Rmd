## Catalog Description

Advanced statistical modeling techniques and data analysis methods, including likelihood-based methods, M-estimation, bootstrap and EM algorithm, and other advanced topics. For example, Jackknife, permutation tests, and nonparametric statistics.

## Course Objectives

The aim of this course is to provide an overview of many statistical inference methods in modern statistical data analysis.

## Learning Outcomes

The students will be able to

1. implement likelihood-based methods to modern data analysis problems.
2. implement computation-based methods, e.g., jackknife, bootstrap, for statistical inference.
3. test statistical hypotheses using permutation and rank tests.
4. use nonparametric techniques for data analysis.
5. apply statistical inference tools, e.g., estimating equations, to evaluate validity and applicability
of data analysis results.
6. implement statistical inference tools in their future work/research.

## Prerequisites

STAT 530, 620, 640.

## Texts

*Essential Statistical Inference: Theory and Methods*, Dennis D Boos and L. A Stefanski, Springer, 2013.

Optional references:  
*All of Statistics: A Concise Course in Statistical Inference*, Larry Wasserman, Springer, 2004.  
*Bayesian and Frequentist Regression Methods*, Jon Wakefield, Springer, 2013.

## Computing

Students are expected to have knowledge of and have access to `R`. `R` is available from http://cran.r-project.org/ and is free. We may use some packages available from the R website.

## Classwork and Grading

**Homework (50%)** Homework will be assigned weekly. All homework assignments are due at **4pm on Fridays**. Each homework assignment will receive equal weight in the final grade. Late work is not accepted unless we have talked about it before the due date.

**Midterm (25%)** There will be one midterm exam on October 19, 2023 (subject to change). 

**Final Exam (25%)** 

A pdf of your homework will need to be turned in to https://canvas.colostate.edu.

Exams will be take-home. More details to follow.

Any homework or exam grading dispute must be submitted in writing to me within one week after the work is returned.

## Policy Regarding Academic Honesty

Statisticians need to have high ethical standards. Thus, I expect each of you to hold high ethical standards and to act with academic integrity in this class. Academic dishonesty will not be tolerated. Students are reminded of the honor code:

 > As a student at Colorado State University, I recognize my active role in building a Campus of Character. This includes my commitment to honesty, integrity, and responsibility within the campus community. As such, I will refrain from acts of academic misconduct.
